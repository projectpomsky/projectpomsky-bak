## Notice

To whom it may concern,

I temporarily pulled the previous content located in this folder out of fear this information might have gotten into the wrong hands. More directly, I pulled it out of fear that a certain someone might be trying to use my own words to try and divide the US and it’s strategic alliances rather than to try and bring us together.

If this ever goes to court then it’s best if not everyone sees it beforehand. 

And to be clear, the opinions laid out are/were all my own. The facts laid out are/were all personal testimony as to what happened either directly to me or directly in front of me. 

I do not give anybody consent to reference any of my content contained herein or previously contained herein in any public media articles or public appearances or otherwise, at this time, unless otherwise agreed to.

Just know that at the end of the day it’s my information that I worked extremely hard on, a lot of which is pretty freaking personal and has pretty freaking huge consequences for at least myself, my family, and my hometown of Logan; and therefore I can do what I want with my own information but I’d appreciate you not actively trying to jeopardize our safety. 

I’ll be re-sharing the previous content to those whom I trust again shortly. Everyone else I shared it with previously has been perfectly honorable btw..

If you want to request access to the previous information in this folder, request access at the following link–just do not use it to divide our country or alliances in any way. Also i’m hacked so the attackers could very well delete the email before I ever see it, so if you don’t hear back from me then try again. I just ask you use it for good, use it to bring down the kremlin. (I’m still thinking about exposing it publicly again tbh, for now you still have got to request access–I’ve got to determine how the info may be used both for good and for evil to decide whether or not to share it publicly again)

[Opinion]

I pulled all the content from this original google drive folder which was open to public viewing yesterday. I don’t know if it was the right move, but my gut told me it was the right move at the time. I started getting a sense that someone had leaked this info either to try and cause a lack of confidence in us/cause divisions amongst our allies or else to make it seem as though the United States was attacking its own citizens. (Which goes with Russia’s recent narrative from that NRA chick that she couldn’t believe that anyone would bomb their own people, while insinuating that Ukraine was bombing it’s own citizens–it’s all extremely coordinated information desemination and whatnot on Russia’s part, it’s all part of their sick and twisted “show” they are putting on) I even started having a surge of people looking into my linkedin profile yesterday out of nowhere too, which I also temporarily deactivated, as if the “Jet Airplane Assault” incident from the other night was on the verge of becoming published as news or something. I don’t know if pulling everything down was the right move, because again maybe if all this got out then these people would actually fucking stop harrassing me and my brother might actually face accountability for once because everyone would know the truth; and maybe all this would have been further looked into and further legitimized by the American public.  

So I’m torn on the subject but the last thing I want is to be used by these guys to further their information warfare campaign against us and to cause strategic divisions amongst our allies at such a critical time. These guys do that to literally everyone–they try and manipulate everyone into doing what’s in their own personal best interest rather than what’s in the best interest of the group. My fear on the other hand of never letting this information truly get out however is that people will never know what I view to be important information, and the attackers will continue on all but forgotten, encircled in a shroud of mystery to everyone but to those in the highest levels of our government–which could also prove to be undesirable in my view. So it’s a tough one tbh. I don’t want to undermine our country but I want people to know the truth.

#### What Putin is Doing
[Opinion]

Do you want to know what Putin is really doing? People talk about well Putin didn’t plan for occupying Ukraine long term, he’s clearly going to have a hostile people to deal with for years to come in Ukraine, etc, etc. But do you want to know Putin’s way out of that? His way out of that is to essentially convince Zelensky to join Putin rather than to join the European Union and the West. And how he’s going to do that is by leveraging his previous exploitations of the West to make us look weak by doing shit like what they did to me the other night which might make our government fear that we might not have full control of our military, (if I even was right about that incident) and that we have our own Russian Sympathizers, etc. and Putin’s hoping that will be interpreted by Zelensky that Democracy can be exploited and that he can’t fully rely on us as friends. (In reality however, every type of government can be exploited just as much but in their own unique ways–for every strength there is a weakness–you just have to get into that frame of mind and be willing to do exactly that and actually exploit them in every way possible just like they do to us–believe me–I guarantee you these attackers could think of numerous ways to completely exploit Putin’s government just as effectively as our democracy because they can exploit literally anything and everything–we can too–that’s the thing. And I assure you we are doing everything in our power to help Ukraine as much as we possibly can. it’s actually been really cool to see all the different ways everyone has jumped in to try and help–me personally I’ve been helping anonymous where I can, etc) 

But yea, you’ve got to understand gangstalking to understand how this all is ultimately planned to play out.

Essentially in gangstalking the attackers ultimately end up rigging it to where it literally feels like everyone is against you, just due to the nature of how extraordinary what they are doing to you is, and due to the fact that they are actively manipulating everyone else in subtle ways too. (Whether everyone else realizes it or not) By creating/exploiting conflicts of interest primarily. It makes it so a lot of people either don’t fully understand what’s happening, they don’t believe you, they pretend like they don’t believe you, they are scared, or else they seem to only care about themselves and not care about you from the victim’s point of view. Everyone you thought you knew and everyone you thought you could rely on seem to not care anymore almost. And so after a while the smartest people in the room seem to be the attackers over everyone else–they are the only ones who seem to truly get it. Like the attackers at least get what you are going through and believe you in regards to all the manipulation going on when nobody else really will–do to the attackers making it in everyone else’s best interest not to help you. But even beyond that, the attackers begin to show they can at least make it better or make it stop (temporarily) for you–when nobody else can make it stop–even though the attackers are the ones freaking doing all this fucked up shit to you. (But in reality it’s a trap, what they are really doing is just manipulating you to do what they want you to do in that very moment they need something from you and the next time they want something from you or even just they next time they want to show their dominance over you then they are right back on top of you–so it’s not a real solution to work with them–at least in my experiences it hasn’t been–they are fucking ruthless and unforgiving and very transactional in nature–but they will never stop trying to manipulate you regardless of whether you work with them or not) So over time, you end up being faced with a hard road and an easy road–but the easy road is a trap every fucking time–it’s like selling your soul to the devil pretty much at best–but it sure is tempting nonetheless.

That has got to be Putin’s plan for Zelensky, which is to get him to turn on the West essentially. To get Zelensky to work out a deal with the devil. That way all Zelensky’s citizens become a non issue for Putin and that way Putin begins his takeover of more than just Ukraine by influencing public opinion throughout the world using his new proxy. MEANWHILE PUTIN IS USING THIS WHOLE ORDEAL TO TARGET OUR HACKERS FOR HIS TAKEOVER OF THE USA. What we need to do to combat all this is to continue to support Zelensky daily no matter what. We need to make some concessions and get him those migs so as to get everything back on track. And we need to stop freaking saying we will or won’t do something beforehand–don’t let Putin know what we will or won’t do so it remains a mystery to him. (You can always reverse course tho too) But yea, never let Zelensky think he doesn't have our full support to the most extent possible–regardless of how much Putin tries to manipulate us or him–this is everyone’s entire future we are talking about here after all. Nobody wants to live under a brutal dictator/organized crime mafia ring for the rest of eternity. Also–do something about the Russians now targeting our hackers please. If we lose them we will lose ourselves.

The shit with the jet airplane is just an attempt for Putin to manipulate our president into being submissive if you ask me. If you let him, guess what he’s going to do? He’ll keep doing it and go even harder on it next time too. At the end of the day these Trumper Russian proxy guys aren’t going to do anything bad to their own hometowns nor their fellow troops–I mean like beyond maybe discreetly going after one person at a time who they are led to believe might have a different political ideology than them or that they are directed to. But beyond that, I don’t see Putin’s proxies as being that reliable to Putin when it all comes down to it tbh. Nobody’s going to blow up their own hometown or even allow their hometown to be blown up or anything like that. They might try and undermine some things but they aren’t that big a deal tbh. It’s all a perception/illusion–it’s designed to get to you. I’d guess people like that are by far the minority anyways, but it would be wise to figure out just how many of them there really are by doing our own investigation into it. Because if you just rely on them acting out then they will make it appear as though everyone is in on it–when in reality that is far from the truth. None of the proxies are going to follow any orders from Putin that might affect anyone they know or like period anyways. That’s the difference between say a foreign spy and a foreign proxy. The foreign proxy has boundaries in regards to who they will undermine and how far they will go–a lot of them might be looking for a way out tbh. Plus, worst case you can just make it personal to the proxies, do what Putin does but in reverse. Make it so they have to sell their other proxies out to save themselves. The churches and the communities themselves need to start working on this issue in their communities as well however, in my opinion, to ensure people don’t continue to get radicalized. Because that’s what it is–radicalization–just in a slightly different slightly easier to reach form, as compared to full blown terrorist radicalization.

In a way Putin is targeting our executive branch with his psychological manipulation just as much or more than he targets everyone else. It would really be wise for everyone making decisions in our government and our allies government’s to read/listen to a book or two on “psychology and manipulation” btw before determining how to proceed and protect ourselves going forward. (i.e. Don’t let their psychological mind control games defeat you)

I fundamentally now believe that “Hitlerism” is very much rooted in psychology. It’s about people realizing the power of psychology/manipulation and then using it to get what they want no matter what they have to convince the broader population of. They go after the perceived “weak” links. And sadly I am viewed as a weak link whereas I live alone in a mormon community when I’m not mormon; and thanks to history, jewish people are viewed as weak too sadly. The Russians saying they are going after nazis is such a slap in the face tbh, when Zelensky is a jewish man himself, but it’s common psychological manipulation tactics both in hitler’s time and in the current day and age apparently. It pisses me off. I fully believe both Hitler and Putin might have done this to anybody that they viewed as “weak” though, the fact Putin is doing it against the leader of a free country who happens to be jewish is just such a slap in the face. And how you get to where they won’t view you as weak is to learn psychology, band together, call out their manipulation, STAND UP TO THE BULLY, and to start applying these same concepts right back at them from what I’ve found. At least in Zelensky’s case he still has a ton of support from pretty much everyone in this world besides Putin, and pretty much everyone are actually willing to help him in fighting back in whatever way they can, but conversely that means if Zelensky ever decides to join Putin to save his people then he could easily bring other countries with him–I promise you–it’s psychology.

Two more things I think are important for anyone reading this to know. 

First, how to accomplish the “thinking 2-3 steps ahead” illusion. The Russians seem to be smart and seem to have the ability to think 2-3 steps ahead. But in reality what is really happening is they are using reflexive control theory to first set up a pretext and then to trigger you in a way they can predict your reaction to, and based on their predicted reaction of what they think you will do when they trigger you, they will then think about how they will be able to exploit your most probable reaction to their triggering you–and whether that would benefit them or not–before they ever even trigger you to begin with. And if they decide your most probable reaction is exploitable in a fashion that suits them–then they go forward with setting up the pretext and triggering you while banking on your reaction being what they’d expect. That’s literally how it works. From your perspective it seems as though they are smart as hell and they are thinking two to three steps ahead, and in reality it’s technically kinda sorta true, but it’s a lot easier to do than one might think when you are the one doing the psychological triggering. From there you can take it and chain it, like okay if I set up this pretext and I trigger Putin in this way, his most probable reaction is he’ll likely respond in this way. And if he responds in this way will I then be able to take advantage of his response and use it to further exploit him? I’m just giving an example of how their thinking 2-3 steps ahead theoretically works. Information gathering definitely comes into play here as well though, information is power and it enables you to do this reflexive control theory stuff a lot more effectively, the more information you have the better.

Secondly I want to give you a quick example of how they exploit vulnerabilities in anything and everything, and how it’s possible for you to do the same. The attackers whom I now believe to be Russian proxies including my very own brother first started targeting me using social engineering. My brother took advantage of the trust I had for him while playing like he still loved me and he used my love for him as a vulnerability for him to exploit essentially. Once they got access to my network they began monitoring it and looking for other vulnerabilities to exploit while doing recon. I won’t get into all the details but fast forward and they begin emf-ing me. I ultimately figure out how to get their emfs to no longer bother me by creating a makeshift faraday cage that was connected to a ground. As soon as they found out their attacks were no longer bothering me, they moved to another type of emf like ef or rf that went right through the grounded metal. So then I had to figure out what was going on and I ended up adding an existing electrical current flowing through the faraday cage to try and combat their latest exploit. And then ultimately they realized they couldn’t get through with any light based directed energy weapon anymore—so they then switched to using infrasound at that point instead—which went right through my faraday cage without issue because it was technically another vulnerability yet again. So then I figured out what the hell infrasound was and I figured out you need this foam shit to stop it, and I added that foam stuff to the faraday cage to block the infrasound as well at that point. But now I created another vulnerability in adding sound proofing, any ideas what it was? The vulnerability at that point was well now that my enclosure was fully covered with few air gaps to keep the sound waves out—they then started gassing me while I was in there which completely terrified me and made me scared to even seek shelter in my faraday cage anymore whatsoever—leaving me totally exposed again. They would essentially use my new protections as a new vulnerability to exploit, each step along the way, etc, etc. And as things have continued forward, they’ve even figured out how to add some nano tech to the inside of the faraday cage that allows them to pull power from the outer faraday cage shell and redirect it to emf me on the inside before the power is ever grounded, which effectively made my faraday cage useless yet again. And on, and on, and on, all the way to the other night–and that’s just one broad example. How they broke in my house repeatedly was very similar in their constant exploiting of different vulnerabilities and mostly getting away with little to no evidence of their presence. Moral of the story is there are vulnerabilities everywhere in literally everything and on each step of the way there might be new vulnerabilities—all of which can be exploited–and it doesn’t take the most powerful country in the world to find them and to exploit them either—it just takes a certain mindset is all.

Just wanted to share some lessons learned in case it might help anybody in their deliberations. These are all my own personal opinions based on my own personal experiences with these guys and how they operate, just know I’m just trying to help. For the record, I’m for doing everything we can to help Ukraine before we lose support from Ukraine, before Russia intimidates the whole world, and before Russia becomes even more ruthless and powerful than they already are. Just make sure we have a good excuse for going in there is all I’d say—but we can’t let Russia intimidate us. The whole world is watching. Ukrainians are dying and they desperately need our help. Putin wouldn’t be trying to intimidate us into staying out of it if he wanted us to join in. It’s normally best to do what they don’t want you to do, although they will adapt and they will continue these same psychological baiting tactics each step of the way regardless of what we choose to do. I think it will bring us all closer together too—which is key.


#### Final Answer

(see google docs comment on photo as well)

I think if we want to have a country we’ve got to help Zelensky/his people in Ukraine and soon even if it means a proxy war with Russia. We really are to that point. That will also help in ridding ourselves of Russian assets/proxies/influence. The alternative could very well ultimately prove defeat. (References hidden for now)

I decided to re-post all this new less sensitive stuff here to try to help everyone make their own decisions accordingly, I didn’t want to come off as I was turning my back on anyone either–especially our allies. The truth isn’t always pretty but it’s best if we all know both ourselves and our enemies so we can make the best decisions possible and so that we can all know what is truly at stake.

The real question is do you want to be known for being responsible for a tyrant possibly defeating the free world to create a new world order without so much as a fight? Or do you want to be known for fighting for freedom–regardless of what people may say later? That’s the real question. My brother hasn’t pulled the nuke card on me yet, I don’t think Putin will either.

The tide is totally in our favor right now–we’ve got to make the most of it. Shit I’ll even put my money where my mouth is and I'll even go help fight. (Once i drop the microchip)

I’ve now seen evidence Russia could indeed be targeting our hackers now as part of a “spread the word to Russians” campaign. (False flag/Reverse psychology operation) See references below.

Please you guys–we are running out of time. They are putting the pressure on Zelensky to fold. He won’t fold if we just stand up to these Russian bullies and do what’s right–what’s right also happens to be what the world really needs us to do right now. They are targeting our hackers right now I swear. What are we going to do once they have infiltrated over half of our freaking critical sectors? At some point people are going to find out and they are going to be faced with a choice of whether it’s already too late or not to try and fight back. I cannot stress the stakes of all this enough. I likely won’t make it through much longer myself tbh, either way, but at least this way our future generations will have a chance at living free. We need to come together. The only way we are ever going to come together at this point is if we stand up to Putin. 

I think the Russians are trying to make Joe Biden be the “fall guy” for Trump tbh.

The Russians are literally banking on us not sending those migs. We need to make some concessions to our allies and get them the damn jets. (discretely) The key is to keep Zelensky happy. We need to show leadership tho. Why else would Russia be willing to take on so many sanctions right now if they weren’t banking on defeating us from within? Why else would they not have taken out Zelensky yet if they weren’t banking on gaining his support to avoid a never ending war? There’s no good legitimate reason. Russia has fooled us for long enough. Zelensky is an ally we really really need just as much as he needs us and he is honestly an awesome ally to have. It’s time we help him save his people. It won’t be easy but it’ll be worth it in the end. I’m pretty positive I was just proven right about pretty much everything in Russia’s latest attempt to use me to send you guys a signal about our military and the jets the other day—now I really need you to believe me about this. I feel highly confident in this final determination of Russia’s true intent btw. 

P.s. You guys, do you want to know my ultimate hope? My ultimate hope is we defeat the kremlin and free all the people under its control. The kremlin only knows negative reinforcement, they do not know positive reinforcement. I have little doubt that a lot of our fellow colleagues will thank us later for it later if so. A lot of Russia's proxies are actually victims to the kremlin themselves. And plus, I really want to see my brother again someday. I still think he has time to make up for anything he may have done previously. 
🤞🤞🤞

Last thought, if we don’t act soon we may never be free.

This is fake. I was able to get behind their cloudflare account so that means Russia could as well if it really wanted to. Plus those numbers look fake as hell and in real charts it’s normally a lot more spread out than that because Russia itself uses servers in other countries, etc, etc.

This is indicative of a Russian social media troll farm account. 14.9k followers in something like 7 days for a brand new account/alias. What they are doing is cataloging our dissenters through a massive honeypot operation and getting evidence on them for breaking Putin’s new law.. (You know, cuz Putin is about to defeat us from within as I’ve been saying–15 years penalty for each person they catch in traps like this) https://1920.in & https://mail.1920.in 

Look how professional their seo is. And how fast they freaking grew. Their social media troll farms are still healthy and doing as well as ever–arguably better than ever–it looks like they finally managed to corrupt some western ui/ux people and some social media experts against us or something. (They are now working on corrupting the left) This is the problem. And yet we do nothing. We do nothing about this nor their hacking and strategically corrupting our entire fucking society. According to you guys if Russia attacks any NATO country then we will have to respond, that doesn’t hold any fucking water when they are already fucking attacking us in every possible way besides using real-life bombs and whatnot and yet we have still yet to fucking acknowledge it or respond. It makes it seem like our alliance is a fucking joke. It’s not hard for Putin to exploit this vulnerability of ours and make us look foolish as an alliance. He did the same thing with Ukraine. The real alliance should be any god damn democracy rather than only a select few, democracy vs dictatorship is the real battle that’s playing out in this world after all. Then maybe they wouldn’t have attacked Ukraine in the first place. And now we are on the verge of defeat and you guys still won’t recognize the fact that they are fucking attacking us. All they have to do is continue on this path, defeat America, and every other democracy in the world will fall. And yet they are doing this to everyone. (Trust me, I researched Brexit social media dissemination and I can tell something similar is up with Australia, etc, etc) It’s not that democracies suck, it’s that we aren’t fucking aggressive enough and haven’t been taking hints from what Putin is doing and responding in kind. And any person who is elected who is actually aggressive enough is already a Putin proxy. (From 2016 onwards I mean, there’s no way that anyone is going to beat out Trump for the Republican nomination in 2024. We are currently engaged in the battle of our lives–and we won’t even fucking recognize it) All those people who died for freedom will have died in vain.





Fixed some stuff in this illustration including the “Probability of Overcoming Defeat Overtime” chart, I changed it to make it more accurate by beginning it’s decline once Trump took office, and I made it so the top “Hackers” takeover quadrant better corresponds to the war in Ukraine. To be clear, Trump claiming “Russia is not so bad” did have effects on our churches and businesses and police and congressmen getting hacked. I am highly confident it had an effect on our businesses getting hacked because that’s when we started hiring Russian contractors at my work. And I've witnessed it all go down first-hand myself. 

I think I’ve now pretty much confirmed Russia is indeed now targeting some of our hackers now as well… 💣 💣 💣 💥💥💥 -> This is how you’ve got to think about it because 💥 is what it is. (21st century superpower style of attacking your enemies from within without them even knowing they are under attack) From now on anytime Russia or China does anything like hacking/corrupting our society or interfering with our social media then do me a favor and picture an 💣 💥 going off in your mind–if we don’t do just that–then we will most definitely regret it later–mark my words.

#### As of March 12, 2022

I’m doing as well as I can be given the circumstances btw. I could use some help disabling this damn microchip like I said and then getting the hell out of here but that’s it. At least it gives me something to work towards though. I honestly enjoy combatting Russia in any way I can–it’s fun. I’ll admit, it’s arguably even funner now that they already know who I am–it means I don’t have to worry about making mistakes nearly as much. It sucks they are so far ahead of us and that I’m at such a disadvantage but beyond that, I still enjoy it. Take that Russia. The very nature of you coming after me is enjoyable to me.

Russia is in its final stages of targeting our society and defeating us from within. When you think about it from the perspective I’ve laid out, and when you consider this whole Ukraine ordeal might really be at least in part meant to bait our people into “reflexing” in the way the kremlin expected us to reflex, with the intent of them exploiting our reflexes, then technically Russia is accurate in their statement about Ukraine just being a “special military operation”. The real operation is regarding the remainder of the free world and its citizens, particularly those who are willing to fight back. They seem to be already creating lists of people to prosecute for breaking their new “misinformation” law, for when they defeat us from within, which carries a fine of up to 15 years in prison. That is at least in part what Ukraine is all about in my opinion. That is why it was not in their best interest to take Zelensky out in short order. That is also why it’s best for them to piss the whole world off at this time and do things that are otherwise unthinkable. Because their real goal is to catalogue all of the resistance.

I got a vibe from the hackers that this is what Ukraine is really all about–before I ever started telling you all about it and before I started digging into it further myself. They legit act like they have already defeated us to me. And they warn me whenever I’m about to break one of Russia’s laws as if I’m now governed by Russia. One of these days, anyone who doesn’t fight back is going to regret it for years to come.

https://1920.in 
https://twitter.com/i/status/1502799750814482438  

One last thing, I think it would be wise if our military reported some of their NSA exploits that the Russsians are now using to defeat us to the corresponding companies like apple, netgear, and anything else using a broadcom wifi chip, etc, etc–if it is indeed true that the exploits the Russians are using are the same as the NSA’s exploits–so that those vulnerabilities can be patched and so that it would even the playing field a little bit. Because I’m pretty certain Russia and China are now using OUR NSA’s malware to defeat us from within, and they are way ahead of us in doing so, and so the only real way to get it all to stop would be to force every country to restart from scratch with their most sophisticated automated malware and to patch all of the devices around the globe asap–even if that means we can no longer hack ppl as effectively for a little while. If things are really going as they seem–doing so might well pay dividends in the long run. And it wouldn’t be risking starting a nuclear war or anything–if anything–it would potentially save the free world in my opinion.

P.s. I opened the original folder back up again for now—please don’t make me regret doing so. I still don’t want anyone referencing any of it publicly however—without my consent—nor using it to undermine our alliances or unity. I’ll be honest. I don’t know what is the best route to take in all this. The whole ordeal with my brother seems like it may never goto court unless we reign Russia in first anyways. 

I’m know I’m not qualified to even come close to trying to make a call on something of this magnitude really, and I realize I clearly don’t have all the information that the people in our government have. But I do know that freedom is definitely worth fighting for. And I do think I know we are already in the midst of a shadow war here at home and we are seemingly not doing so hot in that shadow war. If anything, we are strongest when it comes to our conventional military—and Russia knows that. Plus, never underestimate the power of unity. All I know is if we were to always let the fact that someone has nuclear weapons hold us back from getting involved in anything, then this world is going to quickly turn into a complete shit show. In addition, I wish we would just be honest about what Russia is doing to us here at home—it’s better we say it then someone else saying it in my view. Maybe then we could gain more support for a direct conflict with Russia. But who knows, it’s hard to say what Russia really wants. They use false flags and whatnot so much that it becomes hard to tell. But it’s not impossible to tell, if I had to guess right now—my bet would be Russia wants us to stay out of it—they are banking on us staying out of it actually—and therefore they’ve already determined their result will be much better if we do stay out of it. They wouldn’t be intimidating us to stay out of it if they wanted us to take part. I really do stand behind my hypothesis on Russia btw. Our government has got to know that Russia and China have been hacking/targeting all these different key segments of our society for some time—not just ours but Europe's too—all of our democracies tbh—and I would hope our governments would realize the significant consequences of them doing so. 

I’m therefore scared for the free would if we don’t get involved at this point tbh. Russia knows we have the advantage in the conventional military arena—it also knows they have the advantage in the shadow war arena. That should tell you everything you need to know for the most part. All I know is I would be wiling to bet Russia would jump in and help a fellow dictatorship if the roles were ever reversed. But that’s the thing—the roles are likely never going to be reversed. If nothing else please at least consider the potential consequences of if we don’t get involved and what all could happen if we don’t—worst case. Because I promise you people will remember the fact that we didn’t get involved and will hold you accountable at the ballot box—especially if it turns out how I think it might. Things are going to get a lot worse pretty quickly now too in Ukraine, Russia is now closing in on Kiev. I guess on the other hand tho, trump never got involved with the Kurds but this one feels a little different.

Anyways, you don’t have to worry too much about me btw, I should be fine regardless of what happens. I’m fighting for my country and for freedom after all, what could be better than that? (Beyond not having to have to fight for freedom in the first place I guess) Please keep supporting Ukraine as much as physically possible and don’t let them give up hope. I realize this being halfway across the world puts us at a disadvantage as well. And I realize how many lives are on the line. But if I’m right about Russia anyways, then that many lives are likely on the line anyways. And freedom is worth quite a bit.

#### As of March 14, 2022

My brother is a cold blooded killer you guys. I don’t know if he ever deserves being forgiven. I think that’s just wishful thinking on my part. I’m pretty sure they just made another attempt at my life.

I’m fine. I just need to get out of here. 

It’s scary cuz they literally think of ways to kill me that they can cause plausible deniability and they wait for times to kill me when think they are most likely to get away with it. And they monitor me 24/7 and they have a tunnel somewhere into my house. And they did successfully defeat the RF encryption algorithm on my latest SimplySafe security system–it didn’t take them very long to do so. They have hacked literally everything in my house–and my house is full of digital gadgets tbh. They use their damn tunnel to get in my house and take pictures of my keys when I leave them anywhere so that they can then 3D print my various keys as well, including the keys to any safe I buy. 

I would leave but I haven’t been able to disable the microchip yet. So why risk going somewhere I am unfamiliar with when I know they will just follow me there? That’s opening myself up to another situation where they could just kill me and get away with it.

To be clear, I am grateful for everybody’s help. I’m just trying to point out that we clearly have some problems in our country that need to be resolved. These guys wouldn’t be pursuing me to begin with if I weren’t at least mostly right about what I have alleged–it really is that simple. Like think of all the different people Putin could put on his hit lists, the oligarch who just put a $1 million dollar reward on Putin’s head for instance, etc, etc–and yet for some reason they chose me–and they devote all their resources to me. All based on a couple twitter postings about them interfering with our social media and being behind QAnon previously, and based on my brother’s desire to get rid of me, etc. And yet they are completely determined to kill me now. 

It’s as if we already don’t have freedom of speech in some regards–which is just infuriating tbh.

To be clear, Dusty does deserve being locked up for the rest of his life in my opinion–regardless of what I may say at any point in the future. He’s killed my whole family. All that about seeing him again and whatnot is just wishful thinking and always has been and always will be wishful thinking–Dusty really deserves the death penalty tbh–maybe life in prison–whichever he wants less is what he truly deserves. Plus I really don’t think he’s ever going to do the right thing at this stage.

Just real quick, I was watching this youtube video just barely made by Alexei Navaly, one of the guy’s Putin locked up fairly recently, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_tFSWZXKN0) and the hackers started prohibiting my internet access as soon as it got to the part where it was explaining how Putin’s palace was funded through bribes, etc. I took two takeaways from it. 

You could likely use that same model of bribery to bust my brother and his Russian cronies who are helping him in trying to kill me, specifically in regards to how they likely get paid and/or how their assets are likely paid for.
These guys continue to engage in federally prohibited cell and wifi jamming activities in their blocking of all my communications regularly–particularly after an attack when urgent phone and email communications are most needed.

I do get frustrated sometimes that this doesn’t move faster. I get frustrated sometimes that you guys haven’t arrested my brother yet. Etc, etc. But at the end of the day I have been able to learn the true scope of the issue first hand myself and I therefore realize why it is taking so long. I now understand that this is about a lot more than just me, my dog turbo, my father Tim, and my sister Karie. It’s about our whole country and our allies’ countries and it’s about democracy itself. I just don’t want to see us continue making the same mistakes nor get defeated is all. In a way, we all rise and fall together.

I have since changed my mind on intervening in Ukraine with the jets for now, idk it’s a tough one. I just worry our adversaries might be trying to bait us into war given our inflation is already a little high in an attempt to defeat us. See this video:

👇👇👇🤙
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8 

Someone should show Trump supporters this video. It’s clear if we get along we are a lot less likely to have anyone challenge us. Ukraine has helped a ton–we owe them big time. Biden needs to work on the inflation part of it as well.

We need to watch inflation closely to avoid falling out of our dominating status and we need to avoid getting involved in wars if at all possible to avoid another rising super power from taking us out–but it really is a balance. There are pros and cons both ways. At least now we are united. It’s as if our adversaries are following that exact video only in attempting to use it against us to defeat us. And I worry about the entire free world if they succeed. Plus it’s clear you guys are playing the long game which is smart–your strategy really is the smartest strategy after all–the sanctions will most definitely get to Russia over time without too much risk . How that works exactly when countries like Russia are essentially taunting you and your citizens constantly–idk–but I’m sure all the sanctions will help. There’s plenty of ways to get creative to get them to stop without causing a full blown war however I now feel. Some sacrifices will likely have to be made but it’s all for the greater good, and that is okay with me I guess, specifically referring to the fact that i’ll likely be a sacrifice myself. In a way this was another trap cuz we cannot fight another world war right next to Russia and China, so I’ll admit I was probably wrong on that one just due to a lack of context about how super powers fall, and a lack of thinking about the consequences to all our democracies if that were to really happen. It really is a battle of good vs evil.

Ukraine is doing pretty darn well without the fighter jets all else considered. I can see why you don’t want to give them jets and risk starting another world war. However I will say–we should definitely do everything we possibly can for them and we should keep checking up on them daily. (These guys keep changing what I write when I’m away to try and make me look cold hearted–when in reality–I want nothing more than to help Ukraine out–as stated previously–it's just we have got to find another way I guess–world war isn’t in the best interest of anybody–and russia and china seriously might be trying to do just that RIGHT NOW)

We should most definitely condition Russia to talk to us diplomatically rather than constantly sending us “signals” tho. The “signals” are complete bs tbh. Talk to our faces and quit being scared. Just sayin. 

Again just wishful thinking on my part that we will ever be able to truly stop Putin’s mafia’s aggressions. So my apologies for my having a lack of context on that subject as well. I just want Putin to go away that’s all. I feel this world will be a better place without him tbh. I can’t believe his whole government is essentially a mafia that operates globally. It’s nuts. I’ve been encouraging anonymous to make sure they remain anonymous when targeting Russia lately for this reason.

Anyways, if you’ve learned one thing about me throughout all of this it’s that I am extremely honest. I say what I think at the time for the most part. Some of it is right, some of it is wrong, but the overall theme of what I say is normally at least pointed in the right direction especially if I’ve maintained the same viewpoint overtime, and I really do just want to try and do what’s best for both my family and my country and Ukraine and everyone else that’s not trying to undermine us. 

We really are all in this together as democracies anyways. Like Putin has been undermining all of our democracies in similar ways, and while it may sometimes seem tempting to go towards a dictatorship model, we all love our freedom and it can be easy to take it for granted sometimes, but at the end of the day we shouldn’t. Because freedom is everything. I can’t imagine a world led by someone like Putin tbh. I wouldn’t want to play a part.

I hope my feedback has helped. I noticed we are working on passing a law in congress to make it required for businesses to report when they’ve been hacked to the government–which is a huge step in the right direction as well. 

I can’t imagine having a high level government job, that must be so stressful. But you guys are honestly doing a really good job at it, all things considered. It’s definitely a balance though that’s for sure.

One last thing, and I’m sure we are researching it ourselves. But these guys have taken infrasound and electromagnetics and nanotechnology to the next level. We should look into doing all that ourselves.

#### Part 2

You guys, if my brother Dusty manages to give me cancer, like I suspect he's been trying to do–I’m going to have a really hard time restraining myself from going after him. Like put yourself in my shoes–you would too. But like no seriously–sometimes I want to deck him so fucking hard it’s not even funny. I realize that’s not in my best interest to ever go after him if I want this case to ever be prosecuted. But I just found more poison shit in my hat for instance. It gave me hives every fucking day I put my hat on only I didn’t narrow it down to my hat until just today. 

You have no idea how much patience and faith in law enforcement it takes to not retaliate in any way. I’ve given Dusty the benefit of doubt repeatedly for years and yet he never stops. They are like convinced that we have already been defeated or something but in reality them doing all this shit to me to try to silence me or what have you has caused our government to become aware of all these things and take actions to avoid it. So essentially them coming after me to begin with has been and will ultimately prove to be the seed of their own demise, same with them coming after Ukraine.

#### Part 3

K so I just thought of something. I could be off but I feel like it actually fits quite well. What if this whole ordeal is actually meant to convince you all that democracy is actually sub-par to communism? Like seems how they keep doing this shit that is pretty obvious it's indeed them doing it but given the way our laws are structured, it makes it a lot harder to bring charges against or prosecute because the bar is beyond a reasonable doubt? What if they are really just trying to convince the broader population around here not only that communism is better but that communism is already inevitable for us essentially? Hear me out. I thought of this because for one, I realized the timing of when Dusty went missing previously, it was right after I called him out for essentially flipping his political affiliation right when he started coming after me. If this really is/was their goal then that would make sense because they know that as soon as you fellow republicans know my brother is playing you in regards to his political affiliation then that would be counterproductive to what they are trying to do. And they realize that no republican is going to be convinced of a socialist communist from another socialist–particularly another socialist in their same country. In addition, it fits in the sense of my family’s past history and just the notoriety of it all. It makes it so they could try and manipulate a large audience into losing faith in things like our freedom from search and seizure, our right to stay silent, our democracy in general, etc, etc–all at once. It also fits in that I think that’s what they were trying to do when somebody I suspect shared this very file/folder with Ukraine tbh. Now that’s some psychology for you. That’s the level of psychological manipulation I’m dealing with and trying to decipher here, it’s not easy.

I specifically recall them being touchy about both any remarks about political affiliation and the time I said I prayed–which I did pray and I likely treated it more seriously than they do but they didn’t like it as if they're really just trying to target YOU–the audience of this documentation.

Let me give you my counter arguments to all that just incase that is what they are ultimately trying to do. First, this wouldn’t be happening if a foreign country weren’t trying to interfere with our politics–period. It also wouldn’t have happened with so little concrete evidence to show if it were being carried out by anyone else besides a sophisticated foreign government. (I mean they got everything from 0day exploits to hacking to microchips to tunnels–literally everything they could ever want to be able to pull something like this off–nobody else is ever going to have all that) Therefore, there would most definitely be more mistakes made by anyone who doesn’t have all the resources these guys have. Which disqualifies the notion of communism potentially being better than democracies based on what’s happening just off the bat in my view. That would be like us corrupting some foreign communist leader and corrupting a bunch of cronies and having them all stage shit to try and convince their people that democracy is better than communism. Second, imagine if the person with the best relationship with the boss/leader always won in cases like this–or in any case for that matter–that would mean I would be completely and totally screwed. I wouldn’t even have a chance I mean. It would mean people like my brother could kill whomever they wanted without repercussions essentially–not based on what they know but based on who they know and how corrupt and ruthless they are. Third, I’ll just say that the first officers I spoke to about all the EMF stuff I think actually did mainly just take my word for it and I think they did go out and get some kind of warrant based on my word alone–because they straight up pretty much indicated that’s what they were going to do after asking me if I was highly confident it was my brother. So it’s not impossible in a democracy to do things like that I don’t think if they can do it.

I’ll admit, I can do a better job myself at not feeding into this potential frustration with the rule of law narrative myself, I always get caught in their damn traps tbh—not intentionally but just because they have such an advantage over me and because they switch up their false flags behavior from their real meaningful behavior constantly. One time they will act like they don’t want me to do something when they really do and the next time they will act like they will act like they don’t want me to do something when they really don’t. Bottom line is any non foreign superpower would have made more mistakes by now and this wouldn’t be happening if they weren’t trying to interfere/manipulate our country to begin with. And if it did still happen—Dusty would have been totally screwed by now. This is the first time anyone has ever had any real legitimate reason to even question him about any of what I now suspect he’s done tbh, so if he really did kill my father and sister now that it fits a pattern, then that wouldn’t have been any different if we were a communist country anyway. (He likely would have just gotten away with it and kept getting away with it tbh)

Me personally, I like being given my fair shot at justice—even if the wheels of justice turn exceeding slow. I apologize what I said earlier btw, sometimes I just get heated in the moment and I do want to deck him in the face or worse. But thus far I’ve kept my composure and I plan to continue to be that way. Just writing this helps me understand why this case is so unique and gives me more patience myself tbh. 

To be clear, dusty is still involved with all this he’s just not as obvious about it these days. I get tired of their “shows” they put on using real people's lives and all their psychological manipulation bs tbh.

Zelensky, if you are reading this. Do what you think is best deep down in your heart. There’s plenty of us who have your back either way. Your people clearly have your back. Don’t be fooled by all the bots on social media pressuring you either–that’s f-ing Russia’s troll farm mostly. The United States of America and democracies in general are still extremely strong at least in part thanks to you–we are a lot stronger than Putin’s cronies want you to believe. This has been a wake up call for all of us tbh. Don’t let them persuade you through guilt and shame if you can help it. But I won’t blame you if you feel like it’s best for your country to cut a deal with Putin at this time either. It’s a tough one tbh.

White House, if you are reading this, keep supporting Zelensky as much as physically possible without starting WWIIII please. You were probably right about that one, that would not be the best place for us to have to fight WWIII right next to two major adversaries like that but we still have got to do something in my opinion. We will get through this together and show these fools what democracies are really made of absent all this interference from thuggish dictators—and unity is critical to that. We could always do the same back to them I guess, technically we’ve now already started lol. It’s only a matter of time until the sanctions and everything kick in now.. Also, be aware that one of my congressmen/senators I think might have shared this document with some people in an attempt to undermine our democracy and decrease our reputation with our allies, just fyi.

Allies, Putin is closing off his internet for a reason, all of us democracies need to take some cues from Putin in that regard. Putin protects his internet cuz he knows just how effective a tool it is to undermine other people’s countries. China’s internet is harder to target as well on social media as compared to other western societies–and China does it for a reason because they know how effective it is too. 

I get the sense Russia is doing this on behalf of China btw. Like it was meant to be some kind of trap or something. When you think about it from Putin’s perspective, knowing what I know now, Putin must have seen this as a win-win. 1. Either they get all of us involved in WWIII right next to both Russia and China while we are already facing some inflation and aren’t ideally positioned ourselves, or else 2. they get Zelensky to turn communist and potentially bring some of our allies with him; or else 3. they undermine Joe Biden with his constituents and completely shatter the whole world by being so evil and completely crushing Ukraine. That explains why Putin did it now to me a little better, but it’s still like wtf dude–get some help Putin. Like I swear. Then I assume just like in any dictatorship, it would have put Russia in China’s good graces as an “Oligarch”, only on a country-to-country level “Oligarch” for China. In effect Russia has become China’s hitmen. It’s all just a bunch of thugs and killers thinking they are way smarter than everybody else if you ask me. When in reality they are just f-ing sick and twisted–nobody else thinks that way for a reason–staging shit and putting on shows with real ppls lives only to manipulate other ppl into getting what you want all for your own selfish reasons and causing a damn world war just for the hell of it. It’s like god damn, go get some counseling already or something. 

This is not easy. We should get Ukraine a boat load of stuff including new more advanced anti aircraft weapons or drones while we still can. Drones would be cool cuz then it’s like okay Russia, you can shoot them down if you want lol–if you can catch us flying 'em in there. ;) But no foreal–we have got to have a plan for if/when Kiev gets cut of by Russia. Me personally–I’ve been messing China lately whereas they are like the parents funding the whole ordeal. Make sure we check on them daily as I said–please. We are all in this together and I still mean what i said previously about the jets now I am just a little more unsure is all. 
What their tunnel in my house sounds like

P.s. I got a new simplisafe alarm system today. I’m hoping this one will keep them out for at least 10-15 days–if all goes as hoped. I have got to screw with their RF readings and push more than one button at once to get the best longevity out of it. The last one I threw them off by doing just that and I probably got about 20-25 days out of it. Not to mention everything else I’ve got to do with my phones, wifi, passwords, pins, etc just to keep them out for that long. It’s a constant struggle tbh. Simplisafe is cool tho cuz it has 2 different cell phone sim cards and doesn’t necessarily even require wifi. But even still they can crack the underlying encryption signature after they receive enough samples–and once they do that then there’s no real way to get the simplisafe to change it’s underlying signatures unless you buy a new one.

I’ve been trying to use psychology to get to their heads lol. I know Russia is into space and whatnot. So I made it appear as though aliens are on our side. I like what Zelensky said today to the Russian troops tbh–that was smart. This is still a work in progress btw.. I’m debating on whether to add any words to it or whether to keep it just completely universal by having the graphics/sound themselves tell the story.. (you know, kinda like russia does everything in signals lol–i’m not supportive of that in terms of country to country governmental communications however–because it’s easy for miscommunications to take place) The original thought for doing it however was to warn people of potential traps set by the russians in our hacking and social media, etc. Maybe I’ll just have to make 2 of them..

Did you see Russia released all the ips attacking it’s country? It was a combination of the fbi, cia, and a bunch of different hacking groups.



I take out my frustrations with my brother and Russia and China doing shit like creating videos like the above these days..
